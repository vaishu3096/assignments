Python Assignment:

1)Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Answer: Because they are not written in machine-readable language, Python programs need to be processed before machines can run them. Python is an interpreted language. This means that every time a program is run, its interpreter runs through the code and translates it into machine-readable byte code.

2)Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Answer : Python don't have any problem even if we don't declare the type of variable. It states the kind of variable in the runtime of the program. Python also take cares of the memory management which is crucial in programming. So, Python is a dynamically typed language.

3)List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Answer: 
        Pros:
		
		It has vast collection of libraries
        Its easy to learn and highly available as a human readable code.
		It is object oriented and has built in data structures.
		It is highly compatible.
		
		Cons:
			
		Slow Speed. ...
        Database Access. ...
        Weak in Mobile Computing. ...
        Runtime Errors.
		Poor Memory Efficiency
		
4)In what all domains can we use Python?

 Answer: Web Development
         Data Engineering
		 Data Science

5)What are variable and how can we declare them?

Answer: 
Variables are the basic unit of storage in a programming language. These variables consist of a data type, the variable name, and the value to be assigned to the variable. Unless and until the variables are declared and initialized, they cannot be used in the program.

syntax:
type identifier [identifier];
or
data_type variable_name = value;

6)How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Answer: 

input ( prompt )
raw_input ( prompt )
input (): This function first takes the input from the user and converts it into a string. The type of the returned object always will be <type ‘str’>. It does not evaluate the expression it just returns the complete statement as String. For example, Python provides a built-in function called input which takes the input from the user. When the input function is called it stops the program and waits for the user’s input. When the user presses enter, the program resumes and ret
we can get the input string from the console directly.This also helps us in getting multpile inputs at the same time. we can also get an array as an iput through this function.

7)What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

The default datatype is string.

8)What is type casting?

Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting or, type-conversion. For example, if you want to store a 'long' value into a simple integer then you can type cast 'long' to 'int'. You can convert the values from one type to another explicitly using the cast operator as follows −

(type_name) expression

9)Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

split( ) function helps us get multiple inputs from the user and assign them to the respective variables in one line. This function is generally used to separate a given string into several substrings. However, you can also use it for taking multiple inputs.

10)What are keywords?

Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes. These keywords are always available—you'll never have to import them into your code.

11)Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Keywords in Python are unique reserved words that cannot use a keyword as a variable, function, or other identifiers. These special words are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language. On the other hand, an identifier is a name used to identify entities like class, functions, variables, etc	 
	
12) What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word, all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the same code block.

13)How can we throw some output in Python?

We can use print statements to throw an output in python.

example: print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")

14)What are operators in Python?

operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed. The values that an operator acts on are called operands.
	
15)What is difference between / and // operators?

| is a bitwise operator and compares each operands bitwise.

It is a binary OR Operator and copies a bit to the result it exists in either operands

Whereas || is a logical OR operator and operates on boolean operands. If both the operands are false, then the condition becomes false otherwise it is true.

16) Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuron" \n)


17)Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Answer :
   a=int(input())
if(a%2==0):
  print('The number %d  is an even number' %a)
else:
  print('The number %d  is an odd number' %a)

18)What are boolean operator?

Boolean Operators are simple words (AND, OR, NOT or AND NOT) used as conjunctions to combine or exclude keywords in a search, resulting in more focused and productive results.
   
19)What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0

0 and 0

True and False and True

1 or 0 or 0
```

1 or 0 -----1
0 and 0 ----0
True and False and True ----False
1 oer 0 or 0 -----1

20)What are conditional statements in Python?

A conditional statement is a set of rules considered valid if certain conditions are met. They start with a hypothesis and end with a conclusion and are sometimes referred to as if-then statements
  
21)What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

if… elif…else are conditional statements that provide you with the decision making that is required when you want to execute code based on a particular condition. The if… elif…else statement used in Python helps automate that decision making process.


22)Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

a=int(input())
if(a>=18):
  print("I can Vote")
else:
  print("I can't Vote")

23)Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
